            CARE ALLIANCE 10 is a comprehensive and collaborative effort to set
            aside superficial differences for the benefit of the community as a
            whole. Our philosophy is simple, teamwork is the foundation on which
            all great enterprises are built. In order to achieve this, all
            partners must come to a consensus that operates under the notion
            that all men are created equal.

          <p>
            A study conducted by Brodhag et al suggested that companies who
            invest in Corporate Social Responsibility tend to be more innovative
            and sustainable that companies who don’t. Apple is arguably one of
            the most innovative brands of modern times. Founded in 1976 by Steve
            Jobs and Steve Wozniak, this company that started in a garage and
            has grown to an estimated value of $750 billion. Innovation and
            human capital have value and it doesn’t take long to realize the
            return on this investment. It is estimated that it takes only 3
            years to realize a return on a social investment, this does not
            account for public sentiment and the resulting increased revenue.

          <p>
            According to Urban Bound, it costs between $19,309 and $97,166 to
            relocate a single employee and each year an average of $16.2 million
            is spent on employee relocation. Imagine redirecting a fraction of
            that budget to creating your own unique workforce. A workforce that
            responds expeditiously and with precision to the needs of your
            corporation.

            specific point in time when your brand was able to aid in the

            effectively filled by the local community at a reduced cost to the
            corporation. By pairing the needs of corporations with the resources

            A portion of the proprietary software collects information

            code. The information will not have been generated by a census or

            Ultimately, whether your employees are relocated or locally sourced,
            they will end up living near the work site. ALLIANCE 10 offers
            employers the opportunity to review and project the needs of the
            community and its employees as a result. Additionally, the resource
            centers have numerous volunteer opportunities for dedicated
            corporate volunteers. According to CyberGrants, employees who
            volunteer are happier. As previously mentioned, employees who are
            happier are more productive. CyberGrants also found that employees
            who volunteer together tend to form friendships and tighter bonds. A
            survey conducted by Office Vibe found that 58% of men and 74% of
            women would turn down a higher paying job because they liked their
            coworkers, translating into longer tenures and lower recruitment
            costs.
